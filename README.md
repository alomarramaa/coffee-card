Coffee Card is a website featuring an interactive, 3D coffee corner and drinks. The website features three main sections:

1. The Home page, displaying a 3D coffee shop that the user can interact with.
2. A Drinks page, with recipe cards that detail how to build popular drinks, such as iced vanilla lattes and pumpkin spice lattes. Each recipe card feautures a 3D model of the drink, creating a  videogame feel to the website.
3. A Syrups page, with recipes on how to create popular syrup flavors.

The aim of Coffee Card is to create a videogame like experience, and host popular drink and syrup recipes, making it easy for users to recreate their favorite drinks at home. It aims to simulate a cozy coffee corner, complete with ambient music, and cozy visuals.
